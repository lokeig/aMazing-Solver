This project aims to help people visualize and understand different maze solving algorithms. It’s purpose is to show clear differences between their approaches, and allow the user to learn coding and get a deeper understanding of algorithms.

The program is hosted on a website. On the site the user can create their own maze or generate one automatically. They can then choose between four pre-defined solvers or design their own using ‘aMazing Language’. Once a solver is selected the program visualizes how it solves the maze, providing an interactive learning experience.
