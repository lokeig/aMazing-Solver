The Jest \cite{jest} testing framework is used for all tests.

\subsection{aMazing Language Interpreter}

Each part of the interpreter has above 90\% statement coverage. All remaining statements are for error handling, some of which are unreachable and the rest unreachable given input generated from the previous layer of the interpreter. These are kept in case a bug was missed and they end up being reachable or in case the interpreter is refactored and the same errors are no longer handled in the earlier stages.
